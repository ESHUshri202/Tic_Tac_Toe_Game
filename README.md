# Tic_Tac_Toe_Game


Tic Tac Toe is a popular game played by two players on a 3x3 grid. The game involves taking turns to place a mark, typically X or O, on an empty cell on the board. The objective is to be the first player to get three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all the cells on the grid are filled and neither player has won, the game is considered a tie.

Tic Tac Toe is often used as an educational tool to teach children about logic and strategy. Despite its apparent simplicity, the game can be entertaining and challenging for individuals of all ages.
